--- a protocol where the the phone or app immediately syncs upon close proximity with your pc... with no wifi,no cable, only utilizing what most pcs come with, (mind you i needed to buy a bluetooth usb to give my pc the ability) 
((idea)) 
--instead of being 'serverless"  cant u build a sd card i mean store that shit via sd card/portable storage (phone perhaps?" then reconenct and sync that storage pertinently with watever comptuer ur working with? 
(old fashioned) but will work
--true offline seamlessness only where needed.
